THIS REPO HAS BEEN DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF GLOBAL PIPELINE: https://github.com/therealspring/ndr_plus_global_pipeline

This is the nci ndr that followed the cbd ndr implementation, fixing an issue with not filling in the edges of watersheds.

We are just calling the model within inspring.ndr_plus.ndr_plus import ndr_plus

We have a whole separate repo of the nci ndr analysis (inspring/nci_ndr_analysis) that was last updated in 2020, but I think that implementation of global ndr is now defunct. I'm not putting this scenario script in there to avoid confusion of which NDR we used. Just in case we were wondering what the heck the difference is between the two - this is the "final" one (hopefully there will be no more NCI after this run!)
